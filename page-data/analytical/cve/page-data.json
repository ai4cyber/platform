This new dataset displays information security vulnerabilities and exposures only relevant to the hospital industry.

The text analysis is then run on MonkeyLearn to draw insight (note: MonkeyLearn automatically eliminates stop-words from appearing in our analysis).\r\n5. After the analysis, we exported the ranking list to a csv file where we can analyze our findings (see the first 15 records of data on the next slide).\r\n6.
