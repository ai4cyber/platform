The table was queried to return all IP addresses, products, versions, device types, CPEs and org where the CPE field was not NULL.\r\n3. The data was imported into WEKA and summarized using CPE and product attribute.\r\n4. We utilized CPE data to understand the vulnerabilities for each of it.\r\n5.

It is a supervised classification technique used to classify future objects by assigning class labels to instances/records using conditional probability. It was determined that it would be important to classify the Shodan data by product/CPE. Since the data from product/CPE attributes contains labeled text data we have decided to use the Native Bayes algorithm.
