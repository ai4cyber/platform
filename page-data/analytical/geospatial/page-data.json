Some states (e.g.: FL and WI) have more big data breach cases impacting more individuals, other states have more cases in small organizations.\r\n3. Increased number of cases during the COVID Pandemic (when compared with previous reports).\r\n4. More than 72% of  cases were caused by hacking and IT incidents.\r\n5. Map visualization tool helped us to easily visualize data distribution and made us ask questions and look for answers.\r\n6. This visualization helped us to identify anomaly and patterns to define a cybersecurity strategies.\r\n7.
