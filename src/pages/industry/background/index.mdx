## Key Services & Overall Size of Industry

The hospital industry in the US has three main services (IBISWorld, 2021)

1. Inpatient care – 45.7%
2. Outpatient care – 18.1%
3. Emergency room visits – 36.2%

Surprisingly, industry specific data shows that the market size for hospitals in the US has declined at an annual rate of 1.7% to $968.6 billion over the past 5 years, including a decline of 2.1% in 2021 alone (IBISWorld, 2021). However, industry market size is estimated to grow at an annual rate of 2.5% to $1.1 trillion over the next 5 years to 2026 (IBISWorld, 2021).
 
According to the American Hospital Association, there are currently 6,090 hospitals in the US, with 5,141 being community hospitals (American Hospital Association, n.d.). There are also over 5 million individuals employed within the industry and this is expected to grow at an annual rate of 1.6% over the next 5 years (IBISWorld, 2021).

## Importance of IT for the Industry

The use of Information Technology (IT) within the hospital industry has been proven to significantly improve the quality of care that patients receive. 

Benefits of IT within hospitals include 
  - Helps in delivering more accurate and accessible information related to a patient’s health that can be customized to fit their health needs
  - Better and faster decisions related to health risks to a patient and to the public 
  - Supports communication between patients and healthcare professions 
  - Improved medication safety through better legibility, which helps decrease medication errors

Examples of how IT is used within hospitals:
  - Electronic medical record systems (i.e., EMRs, EHRs, and PHRs), telehealth, medical equipment, remote patient monitoring, patient portals, electronic prescribing
