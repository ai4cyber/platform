## Who generates the data?

MITRE CVE is a platform that provides publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures data.

***

## Is the data relevant?

Components utilized within hospitals (i.e., medical software & devices), can be suspectable to the vulnerabilities identified in the CVE list. Also, it helps to lookup the vulnerabilities by dates and provides released versions data and other helpful references.

***

## Is the data of high quality?

The data is updated regularly and is operated by The Mitre Corporation with funding from both the US National Cyber Security Division and the US Department of Homeland Security.

***

## Is the data accessible?

The CVE list is easily downloadable (csv file) from the MITRE CVE website.

***

## Why did we select this data source and what value does it bring?

MITRE CVE provides a list of known vulnerabilities which will help us in identifying which components within a hospital have vulnerabilities.

***

## What is the Collection Strategy?

- Downloaded the CVE list from the MITRE CVE website.
- File was stored in a mySQL server for analysis
