## Health care industry Cyberattack statistics

  - The total count of US healthcare breaches rose from 386 in 2019 to 599 in 2020, an increase of **55.1%**.
  - Healthcare data breaches are the costliest with the average cost increasing by $2 million to **$9.42 million** per incident.
  - **91.2%** of breach incidents that resulted in theft of personal information were attributed to healthcare cyberattacks.
  - About **26 million** patient records were exposed to unauthorized parties in the US in 2020, with about 24.1 millions of those as the result of healthcare cyberattacks.

## Human Error or malicious activity

  - The Wyoming Department of Health became aware of an unintentional exposure of 53 files containing COVID-19 and influenza test result data and one file containing breath alcohol test results which was accidentally uploaded in GitHub.
  - Med-Data says a former worker saved files containing PHI in personal folders on the GitHub platform sometime between December 2018 and September 2019.

## Impact on hospitals due to cyber attack

  - In 2019, cybercriminals breached 130,000 records at Kalispell Regional Healthcare (KRH) in Montana. A lawsuit was brought against KRH, and they eventually reached a settlement of **$4.2 million** with those affected.
  - University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Hospital paid hackers **$1.14 million** in bitcoin after a ransomware attack.
  - A researcher at Vanderbuilt University determined that data breaches at hospitals could be linked to thousands of patient deaths. The research showed an increase in **mortality rate of 0.23 percent one-year** post-breach and an increase of 0.36 percent two years post-breach. This came to over **2,100 deaths**.

With digitalization of health care industry there is increase in IT systems and networks which includes:
  - Applications like  EMR , (electronic medical record), EHR (Electronic Health record), CIS (clinical information system), patient portal.
  - Hardware medical IOT devices like Remote patience monitoring, Heart Rate monitoring, Glucose monitoring , CT Scan, MRI, Robotic Surgery which are connected to network.
  - Many end points like laptop, mobile, or iPad used patient, medical staff or  vendors.
  - Transmission of confidential data across internet for data exchange between IT systems.

**All the points above increases the attack surface for the hackers, and it is very difficult for the security analyst to cope up with these threats for this industry.**

## Challenges Cyber security team face due to data volume

More than half (56%) of large companies handle at least 1,000 alerts per day because of
  - Constant change to the type of security threats that must be blocked.
  - Addition of new tools to monitor for these threats.
  - Overall growth of business applications and services. 
  - Increase in cloud infrastructure. 
  - Growth in user endpoints to monitor.

## How can AI help Cyber Security team?

  - Deploy AI on network to detect all types of attacks and help  prioritize and prevent them.
  - AI scans entire system and checks for any possible threats. Unlike humans, AI will identify threats extremely early and simplify your security tasks.
  - AI has proven to be one of the best technologies in mapping and stopping unknown threats from ravaging a company
  - AI detect and identify any threats hidden in the sea of chaotic traffic.
  - Identifies weak points in computer systems and business networks and helps businesses focus on important security tasks.
