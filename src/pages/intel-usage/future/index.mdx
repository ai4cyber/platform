- Addition of a Security information and event management (SIEM). This will normalize and aggregate the data collected from various sources (i.e., IoT devices, servers, etc.). The SIEM will analyze the data to discover and detect threats. Ultimately, this will pinpoint security beaches and allow hospitals to investigate potential alerts.
- Real time integrations: Implement real-time streaming of data to provide most up-to-date data for platform. This will also allow for real-time dashboards and visualizations.
- Implement Robotics Process Automation (RPA) to access Shodan Data on a week-to-week basis. This will allow hospitals to monitor the shift in various protocols and products.
- Add a direct feed to our platform that includes vulnerabilities identified in the MITRE/CVE database. This will show current threats related to the hospital industry in real time.
